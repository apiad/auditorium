# This is a demo slideshow to showcase the main features of `auditorium`.
# In auditorium, a slideshow starts with a `Show` class.
# We also want to import `Context` now, since we'll use it later on for intellisense.

# We beging by creating an instance of the Show.

show = Show()

# A show is composed of slides. Each slide is a function, decorated with
# a special `slide` decorator. Slides are implemented with the `async/await` pattern,
# since under the hood there is a bidirectional connection with the browser
# via websockets.

    # This is the first slide that will be loaded.
    # Don't worry too much about the content of this method right now, since all of this stuff
    # will be explained in the next slides.

    # Just keep in mind that each slide is an async method that receives a single parameter
    # of type `Context`, which you can use to create and animate HTML objects, as well
    # as to control the state of the slideshow.

    # Everything you do with a `Context` here will be relayed through a websocket to every client
    # that's rendering this slide.
    # For this reason, you'll use a lot of `await` clauses.

    # The next few lines are basically creating a few texts inside a vertically oriented layout,
    # and styled with transparency or scale so that when the slide loads, the HTML elements are
    # created but invisible.

    # We'll see this in more detail later on.

    # create HTML elements and animate them using a mix of JavaScript and CSS.

    # To fill it with content, we need to create `Component`s.

Auditorium is a Python-powered webpage generator.
You write pure Python code, and obtain an HTML+CSS+JS single page application.
You manage a virtual DOM in Python that gets automatically updated on the frontend app, with bidirectional communication.
This means that anything you do in the Python DOM gets reflected on the webpage instantly, plus anything that happens on the frontend (i.e., user interaction) is automatically sent over to your code.

## Installation

Simply run:

    pip install auditorium[uvicorn]

> Quickly setup a Python 3 library complete with continuous integration, code coverage and automatic deployment to PyPi in 5 minutes.

## What's this about?

Have you ever wanted to make a Python library available on PyPi, but struggled with all the fuss about `setup.py`, continuous integration, unit testing, and such? I know I have.

After reading a bunch of tutorials and trying a few different ways on my own, this is the most condensed and streamlined checklist I've come up with. Just by forking this project and following the next few steps you'll be up on your own with a brand new Python library project, together with unit testing, continuous integration, code coverage, and automatic deployment to PyPi. Tag along.

## Instructions

1. [Fork](https://github.com/apiad/python-starter-pack) this project on Github.
2. The `python_starter_pack` folder where the source lies. Change the folder name and put your code inside.
3. Head over to `setup.py` and modify the lines marked with `TODO`, to fill in your project info.
4. Head over to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org) and activate your project. Register with Github if you haven't already.
5. Modify the `LICENSE` file to suit your preferences.

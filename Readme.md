> A Python-powered slideshow creator with steroids.

## What's this about

Auditorium is a Python-powered slideshow generator.

You write pure Python code, and obtain an HTML+JavaScript slideshow.
The awesomeness comes from the fact that your Python backend is connected to the slideshow frontend, which allows your slideshow to dynamically change according to user input or automatically.

This opens the door to a few interesting use cases:

*  The slides content itself can be generated by code. For example, long and repetitive sets of slides can be automatically generated, or tables and graphs embedded in slides can be generated on-the-fly with `matplotlib`, `bokeh`, `altair`, `plotly`, or any visualization package that produces HTML output.
*  You can insert components in the slides that respond to user input, and execute a Python code in response. For example, you can generate an interactive graph that can be modified by moving sliders in a slideshow.
*  You can create beautiful animations with simple Python code, that automatically play on a slide, using visualization libraries or simple HTML markup.

> **And all of this without writing a single line of HTML or JavaScript.**
